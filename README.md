# WHAT IS THAT

Get your KAT torrents without all the advertising crap. Type "kat" followed by what you're looking for, wait a bit (it's quick), choose your torrent and make some space on your HD.

Now you can also use #tags.

Now you can also sort ^seeders.

# WHY IS THAT

There's a [KAT workflow](http://www.packal.org/workflow/kat-search) already on [packal.org](http://www.packal.org), but it doesn't work for me (SSL error). I contacted the author but got no answer, so I built this one. If the other one on Packal works it might be better to use it, it might have more options, or maybe not, I don't know, la la la la la.

# SETUP

NO SETUP! But the KAT URL is an Alfred workflow variable so you can replace it with a mirror in case the main site is down.

# PRO USERS

The workflow opens the magnet with the magnet default application of your Mac. If you prefer using a command-line client, you can add a `cli` variable in the [Workflow Environment Variables](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/advanced/variables/#environment). The value should be the full path to your torrent client with a `{magnet}` variable that will be replaced by the selected magnet (e.g. `/usr/local/bin/transmission-remote -a {magnet}`).

You can also copy the magnet to the clipboard rather than opening it (and starting the download) by using the ⌘ modifier.

# HUH WASNT THIS WRITTEN IN PHP B4?

Totally. But Apple is getting rid of interpreters in macOS. That means that to use this Workflow I would have to ask you to install PHP. And probably some specific version. And probably in some specific place. That Sucks™. So it's now written in Swift.

PHP version is still available here: https://github.com/godbout/alfred-kat. It will be missed. Source code was beautiful. (The last comment might be due to delusion of grandeur.)
